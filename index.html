            <p class="bio-text">Okay, that's my BIO, told through kilometers and aspirations.<br><br><br>I was born in Argentina and spent 18 years in Spain. Afterward, I lived in London for three years, which included navigating the challenges of the pandemic. Over the past year, I've been dividing my time between Italy and Spain with the goal of establishing permanent residence in Italy (hopefully soon).<br> <br>My education has been a mix of academic and self-taught learning, spanning various areas that share common threads, such as <b>cinema, photography, graphic design, digital marketing, and copywriting.</b> While I haven't had the opportunity to fully immerse myself in any of these fields, they have all allowed me to achieve a multidisciplinary creative background.<br> <br>A few months ago, I considered the possibility of transitioning into web development, despite it being an entirely new field for me. I saw it as a secure career path where I could also apply my creativity. <br>Since enrolling in <b>the Front-End Development Master's program at start2impact University,</b> I have started to discover an exciting new world and I'm eager to keep moving forward and embark on what, I'm sure, will be a fulfilling professional and personal journey.<br> <br>I'm passionate about traveling, exploring new cultures, and discovering different perspectives of the world. Also, I'm consistently interested in attending and consuming all kinds of artistic content.<br> <br>Furthermore, I try to prioritize maintaining physical and mental well-being in my daily life through workouts and meditation, as I believe it's the key to staying focused on clear objectives that bring us closer to our purposes.
